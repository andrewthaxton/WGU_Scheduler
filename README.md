How to run program: Logging in with username and password opens an alert displaying upcoming appointments (if any).
You will be taken too the Home page with a various buttons to press that will take you to the Customers page, Appointments
page, the Type/Month report, the Contact Schedules, or a list of the appointments for today. Or you can click Exit to close
the application. On the Customers page you will see a list of customers and some buttons. You will have the option to add,
update, or delete customers. In the add screen you will be able fill in the fields required for customer creation including
a country and division combo box. Selecting the country first will filter the divisions to the division inside that country.
The update page is very similar to the add customer page except with preloaded information. You can click Home to return to
the Home page. In the appointments screen you will see a list of all appointments. You can filter the list to display the
month or the week and use the next and previous buttons to navigate to different months or weeks. You will have the option
to add, update, or delete appointments as well that operate similarly to the customer page. Again you can click Home to
return to the Home screen. The Type/Month report will open a table list all the different types and months along with how
many there are. The Contact schedules will open all appointments initially, but will be filter depending on the contact you
select from the combo box. Finally, the Today's Appointment screen will just open a table showing all of the appointments
for the current day.

Additional Report: For my additional report I chose to do a report of all the appointments for the current day. I thought
this report would be useful because it allows a user to check their schedule for the day with one easy click.
